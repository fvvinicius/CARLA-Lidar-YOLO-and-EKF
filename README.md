This project was developed as my Master of Engineering Capstone. As much of the information here was hard to come across, I have uploaded the code I developed in hope that it will help someone in the future.

This is broken down into 3 Modules:
1. Computer Vision, that incorporates a YOLO v8 model and another model that I trained in TensorFlow to predict traffic color lights
2. LiDAR, used to predict obstacles ahead of the ego vehicle
3. EKF, to better estimate the vehicle's state

Please reach out if you have any questions!
